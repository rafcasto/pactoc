# Invitation Filtering Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Description
The issue was that when a new nutritionist (like `rafael@techdojo.pro`) logged in, they could see all invitations in the system instead of only their own invitations.

## Root Cause Analysis
The problem had two main causes:

1. **Missing Nutritionist Profile**: When `rafael@techdojo.pro` logged in, they didn't have a corresponding nutritionist profile in the database, which caused the filtering to fail.

2. **Inadequate Error Handling**: When a nutritionist profile wasn't found, the system wasn't handling the error gracefully, potentially causing it to show all invitations as a fallback.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Authentication Validation
- Added validation to ensure user UID is properly extracted from Firebase token
- Improved error messages for debugging authentication issues

### 2. Automatic Nutritionist Registration
- Implemented auto-registration for authenticated users who don't have a nutritionist profile
- This prevents the "nutritionist not found" error that could cause data leakage
- New users are automatically registered with basic information

### 3. Stricter Database Filtering
- Enhanced the invitation filtering to explicitly filter by `nutritionist_id`
- Added additional debug information to API responses
- Ensured all invitation queries strictly filter by the authenticated nutritionist's ID

### 4. Applied to Multiple Endpoints
- Fixed both `/api/invitations` and `/api/workflow/dashboard` endpoints
- Ensured consistent filtering across all invitation-related endpoints

## Code Changes Made

### File: `backend/app/routes/invitations.py`
```python
# Enhanced list_invitations() function with:
- Better user UID validation
- Auto-registration for missing nutritionist profiles
- Stricter filtering by nutritionist_id
- Debug information in responses
```

### File: `backend/app/services/meal_plan_workflow_service.py`
```python
# Enhanced get_nutritionist_dashboard_data() function with:
- Auto-registration for missing nutritionist profiles
- Stricter filtering by nutritionist_id
- Better error handling
```

## Verification

### Database State Verification
Run the test script to verify proper data separation:
```bash
cd backend && ./venv/bin/python scripts/test_invitation_filtering.py
```

### Current Database State
- Nutritionist 1 (l0ch7wC7FIMaMcjw1kLx1V1Ge5k1): 5 invitations
- Nutritionist 2 (AbC53BQjEvNsax55Nqucaumcqm42): 2 invitations
- All invitations are properly assigned to nutritionists
- No orphaned invitations exist

## How It Works Now

1. **User Login**: When `rafael@techdojo.pro` logs in with Firebase authentication
2. **Profile Check**: System checks if nutritionist profile exists for their Firebase UID
3. **Auto-Registration**: If no profile exists, system automatically creates one
4. **Strict Filtering**: All invitation queries filter strictly by the nutritionist's ID
5. **Secure Response**: User only sees their own invitations

## Benefits of This Solution

1. **Security**: Each nutritionist can only see their own invitations
2. **User Experience**: New users are automatically set up without manual intervention
3. **Data Integrity**: All invitations are properly associated with nutritionists
4. **Debugging**: Enhanced logging and debug information for troubleshooting

## Testing Instructions

1. Start the development server
2. Log in as any nutritionist through the frontend
3. Navigate to the invitations page
4. Verify that only invitations belonging to that nutritionist are visible

## Future Improvements

1. **Proper Registration Flow**: Implement a dedicated nutritionist registration page
2. **Profile Management**: Allow nutritionists to update their profile information
3. **Role-Based Access**: Add different permission levels for different types of users
4. **Audit Logging**: Track which nutritionist accesses which invitations

## Files Modified

- `backend/app/routes/invitations.py`
- `backend/app/services/meal_plan_workflow_service.py`
- `backend/scripts/test_invitation_filtering.py` (new)
- `backend/scripts/add_nutritionist.py` (new)

The issue has been completely resolved and the system now properly isolates invitation data per nutritionist.
